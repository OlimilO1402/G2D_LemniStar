# LemniStar
## self-intersecting shape 
Star peaks moving along a lemniscate producing moiree effects with the self intersecting shape.
Project was started in december 2009. The idea came to my mind while playing around with shapes 
in Corel-Draw, maybe around 1998.  
During animation you have the following keyboard commands:  
+ / - : scale the star bigger / smaller  
a / s : add / remove star peaks  
p     : pause  
o     : change rotation direction

Maybe have a look at this video where you can watch the moirees appear.
