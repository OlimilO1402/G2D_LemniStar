Star peaks moving along a lemniscate producing moiree effects with the self intersecting shape.
Project was started in december 2009. The idea came to my mind while playing around with shapes 
in Corel-Draw 3, maybe around 1998.  
During animation you have the following keyboard commands:  
 + / - : scale the star bigger / smaller  
 a / s : add / remove star peaks  
 p     : pause  
 o     : change rotation direction

Maybe have a look at this video where you can watch the moirees appear.
