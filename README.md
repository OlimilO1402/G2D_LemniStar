# LemniStar
A star whose every peak-valley moves along a lemniscate (=8) around the fix peaks.
Pretty nice moir√© patterns appear at filling the resulting self intersecting shape.
Project was started in dec. 2009 due to an idea that came to my mind a long time
ago while playing around with Shapes in Corel-Draw, maybe around 1998.  
Starting the project starts the animation. During animation you have the following
keyboard commands:  
++ / - : scale the star bigger / smaller  
a / s : add / remove star peaks  
p     : pause  
o     : change rotation direction
